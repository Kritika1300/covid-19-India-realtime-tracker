#Covid-19 India Dashboard(Desktop App)

This app has been built using Python and Its GUI has been designed using PyQt5. The Earlier version of this app depended upon 
web scrapping for its database. But now the app has been updated to work using APIs provided by https://www.covid19india.org/ so a huge shoutout to them!
Everytime you load the app , it fetches the latest dataset regarding the covid-19 cases in all the Indian states/U.T.s using the apis and provides an interactive UI for the user. 
Graphical Analysis is possible. You can zoom in the graphs for detailed Information and trends and to check date-wise cases.
I have inlcuded the source code if anyonw wants to do anything , they are more than welcome :). Also i have included an exe file so the users don't have to download anything except the
exe and the Pictuers folder!
Also you need an Internet connection so that the app can load the data :)
I am attaching some screenshots down below :)
